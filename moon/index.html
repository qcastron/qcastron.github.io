                        <h5>What do we mean by "personal information?"</h5>
                        <p>For us, "personal information" means information which either directly identifies you (like
                            your name, email address, or phone number) or can be reasonably linked or combined to
                            identify you (like student number or IP address). We'll always tell you what personal
                            information we’re collecting from you. See each form’s Privacy Notice or Privacy Statement
                            for specific details.</p>
                        <p>Any information that falls outside this is "non-personal information."</p>
                        <p>If we store your personal information with information that is non-personal, we will consider
                            the combination as personal information. If we remove all personal information from a set of
                            data then the remaining is non-personal information.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>you give it to us directly (e.g., when you sign up for membership);</li>
                            <li>we collect it automatically through our products and services (e.g., when you email,
                                instant-message or call us);</li>
                            <li>someone else tells us information about you (e.g., when other entities refers you to
                                us); or</li>
                            <li>when we try to understand more about you based on information you've given to us (e.g.,
                                when we use your IP address and user behaviour to optimise our website experience).</li>

                        <p>When you give us information, we will use it in the ways for which you've given us
                            permission. Generally, we use your information to help us provide and improve our products
                            and services for you.</p>

                            <li>When we are fulfilling our mission of promoting astronomy and building bonds among
                                brothers, directly or incidentally, we sometimes release information to make our
                                products or services better. But when we do so, we will remove your personal information
                                and try to disclose it in a way that minimizes the risk of you being re-identified.</li>
                            <li>When the law requires it. We follow the law whenever we receive requests about you from
                                a government or related to a lawsuit. We'll notify you when we're asked to hand over
                                your personal information in this way unless we're legally prohibited from doing so.
                                When we receive requests like this, we'll only release your personal information if we
                                have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. Nothing in this policy is
                                intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party's
                                request to disclose your information.</li>
                            <li>When we believe it is necessary to prevent harm to you or someone else. We will only
                                share your information in this way if we have a good faith belief that it is reasonably
                                necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of you, our other users, Queen's
                                College Astronomers' Club or the public.</li>
                            <li>If our organizational structure or status changes (if we undergo a restructuring) we may
                                pass your information to a successor or affiliate.</li>

                        <p>We are committed to protecting your personal information once we have it. We implement
                            physical, business and technical security measures. Despite our efforts, if we learn of a
                            security breach, we'll notify you so that you can take appropriate protective steps.</p>
                        <p>We also don't want your personal information for any longer than we need it, so we only keep
                            it long enough to do what we collected it for. Once we don't need it, we take steps to
                            destroy it unless we are required by law to keep it longer.</p>

                        <p>We may need to change this policy and our notices. The updates will be posted online. If the
                            changes are substantive, we will announce the update through the Club's usual channels for
                            such announcements such as social media posts or emails. Your continued use of the product
                            or service after the effective date of such changes constitutes your acceptance of such
                            changes. To make your review more convenient, we will post an effective date at the top of
                            the page.</p>
